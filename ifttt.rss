<h3 id="the-paperplattune">The Paperplattune!</h3>

<p>Since the future of free publications implicating links to data in a semi-regulated data-market is kinda uncertain, i was looking at alternatives for the webzurfs. During my quest, lured by a very cool-looking marketing bot, i chackked the platoon out.</p>

<p>And you should too! Damn, The geeky level of this i feeeel!  BUT NOT TOO MUCH! persona with g33k-values, in POWER! Crypto AF. Stupid smart level 7000.</p>

<p>Dirty, yet slick production outlet! The quirks of their web-path is dark and probably scary for the non-techie. Funky links and sexy shells all the way. Dadang you should follow that whole rabbit hole!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>徒 Setto セット is at it again! This time with an amazing cover art illustration by the designer of the basspistol logo: <a href="https://ritarn.com/" target="_blank">Mattias “Ritarn” Lindström</a></p>

<p>While the A-side offers a sweet balade about taking social initiatives away from the the web, its b-side opens up for a new, dark voice. The story of a network misfit, finding it hard to cut through the noise of cats, selfies and political propaganda. But what if there was another space within that space? What if there was a place the strange could call a home? Well there is one, it’s nicknamed “Darkweb” and you might like it.</p>

<p><em>As dystopian as the present might seem on-line, there is always room for a strange future in the cypher. At the end of the tunnel through the flashy but controlled cyberspace we call the “Internet”, a light of hope for the underground is shining.</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>徒 Setto セット is releasing on basspistol in 2019! First out is the 2 track EP “Satoshi Mon Ami”.</p>

<p>The 2 tracks of laid back cloud rap are tales of daily didigtal life-struggles. When day-to-day communication blurrs the line between the virtual and real. Being close to someone, without them knowing, anonymoulsy and obsesively thorugh a device. Decrypting interconnected sub-stories from every node in the graph and losing your mind on it.</p>

<p>What’s the latest story? FOMO to the max, The Fear Of Missing Out!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Every now in then, our dimension aligns with a thousand year old intergalactic tradition called #AcidDecember. When this happens, musicians worldwide are compulsively submitting tracks to a mysterious email address. These pieces of delicious music are then being published one by one on http://acid.datapop.se during December and beyond.</p>

<p>We’re late on the news; it started the 1st of December and there are already 5 delicious tracks published. However, it would seem it is possible to contribute during the entire month. Are you going to send something in?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Los Ganglios is a Spanish PORC band (a conglomerate Punk Techno Rock and Cumbia) with a really strong and peculiar vibe. To some extend many of their tracks will feel plain weird to the non-Spanish speaking audience. But the videos they put out should appeal to anyone with a bit of humor and a taste for anti-aestethics and retro-computing.</p>

<p>The way they merge the ordinary with the extraordinary is quite mesmerising. If you are lucky to find yourself in a city where <a href="http://losganglios.com/agenda/" title="Los Ganglios dates">they are touring,</a> you need to go: Live they burn down the roof using a simple and effective set-up of hardware electronics combined with guitars and a chanting choir of die-hard fans.</p>

    <id>https://basspistol.com/highlights/phenomonalyyung</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Recently, a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gabbaboy?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="Gabba Boy Soundlcoud">good friend</a> of mine snitched a link to me. A crew of yungsters from my home town. I’m no stranger to the leaners and their music. But listening to this I had to reflect a little around the movement that’s been here for a while now.</p>

<p>It seems to be easy for people of my generation to dismiss the Lean movement as lazy and unoriginal. I think it’s beautiful. While these yungsters tend to use networks controlled by Babylon such as YouLube, Instagrat and CloudSound, they use them so well that it sometimes feel like they actually run them. Yes, hiphop has changed, but the fetish for codes and idioms remains. This time the influences are broader though. The aesthetics comes from everywhere and no one seems to give the slightest ufck about copyright. How could I not applause that?</p>

<p>The way they conceive bands is radically different from how it use to be; Given how important the full experience has become, with video being the main mode of consuming entertainment, the camera-man and video editor has replaced the drummer. The make-up artists and hair dressers pushed of the keyboardist from the stage. The MC remains backed by the crew and elevated by the producers and their pirated music software. All of them jumping on stage during the concerts in front of a proud local crowd that knows the lyrics by heart.</p>

<p>Maybe the overused trap snare is there, maybe the wavy astethics and burner phones are there, maybe the phat blunt and the purple drank is there, maybe it’s all the same sound all over the globe. But so it was during the boombap and g-funk days. Same same but different codes. Things evolve, naturally.</p>

<p>I feel the leaners, are more inclusive then we were though. The attitude is welcoming any sort of style and body type. You can hear this music where ever you go in the world. And while they tend to sing in their native tongue, the same baseline of the codex is present everywhere: These yung people understand each other beyond borders in encompassing ways i’ve never seen before. Sure, in my days we had breakdance, turntablism and graffiti. But we also had a lot of taboos. Copying success was being an unoriginal copycat; a toy. In this movement, copycating is key. It’s like a cross bread between creative commons and memes with international unity sprinkled on top. You may say it is lyrically levelled to lowest common denominator. And I’ll agree to disagree: it’s levelled. Just about anyone can decide to do it. There are no more gate-keeping talent required. It’s all measured in how much you’ll dare to add your own personality to your jam, including your flaws. You don’t have to be pretty; instead you have to have a DIY brand. Preferably backed by hoard of yungsters waving the same brand on their swag or in a tattoo.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeJQNYmVGPtbmjfES7GgITA?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="CLR Youtube Channel">CLR</a> caught my attention immediately. I’d been wondering who write those modern graffitis depicting LUX in Geneva because I think they set a new standard for style in the city. The videos contains images of places in Geneva where I would be at their age. But the angle they are showing is elevating these places to underground levels I wouldn’t have dreamed of at their age. Times are tougher in Switzerland. Geneva used to be full of alternativ space for creativity. There still is creativity, but the space is small, and while it’s a sad thing, it would seem that it has forced the newer generations to step up their game.</p>

<p>But don’t take my words for it. Just go ahead and make your own impressoin; listen to and download <a href="https://www.hauteculture.com/mixtape/28455/ratitude?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="Ratitude on Haute Culture">Ratitude on HauteCulture</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <h3 id="welcome-back-earthling">Welcome back earthling!</h3>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OhSNpX18eLo?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="Hijack - Back To Brixton">It’s been a long time coming</a>. 5 years of silence is…</p>

<p>My name is <a href="https://set.hallstrom.ch?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="Set's Website">Set</a>, i’m a co-founder of The Outernational Music Syndicate and currently the main contributor. I could make up all sorts of excuses as to why it’s been silent for so long, I could go on and ramble about the good ol’ past, and how together with a couple of people we founded this syndicate in a chat-conversation and made it real on January 7th 2010. Or how at first the idea was to create a booking agency that would be the exact opposite of everything that sucked with booking agencies. I could continue on about how we were given this awesome server by <a href="http://alsenet.com?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="Alsenet.com">Alexander Poltorak</a> and started to distribute music. But all I will do in that regard is to emphasise <a href="http://alsenet.com?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="Alsenet.com">Alsenet.com</a> because really <a href="http://alsenet.com?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="Alsenet.com">Alsenet.com</a>, from our standpoint, deserves all the love we can give them. (To suport Alsenet, share their Software with your neighbour!)</p>

<h3 id="however-this-post-is-about-the-present">However, this post is about the present</h3>

<p>The present of Basspistol and eventually of music. The past and the future cannot be contained in a frame. They operate like dreams: their form, meaning and relevance are subjective and personal. They are visions that are oh so difficult to transmit. But the present… That! …is something we can hold on to. Something we can affect, in affect with effect. Today the music industry is ruled by a very strange set of data. It has different names but represents the same values: “likes”, “shares”, “favorits”, “retweets”… As if music was a measurable artform on a human scale. This illusion is reinforced by the recurrent televised competitions where creativity is tamed, bent, violated and normalised for the greater consumer’s good. Countless web-logs are using the oldest tricks in the books: appeal to your guts, twinkle with your genitals and feed you with sugar. To find out which kind of sweetness you prefer, data is captured, statistics are analysed and the conclusion these lead to form the next publication. Don’t get me wrong, I’m an amateur SysAdmin, I LOVE stats. Making A-B tests to see what works on most of you or what doesn’t gives me a god-like feeling: control! But when it comes to Art, does it really matter what the fuck everyone thinks? Well, if you need to fill up that excel sheet with reassuring ciphers that bring food on your table, it probably does. But to me it doesn’t. And hence I see an opportunity in this, that is not given to any- and everyone, that I decided to capture: Spending free time and energy on something i enjoy doing. Namely listen to rare contemporary music from all azimuths and communicate what it makes me feel.</p>

<h3 id="what-we-do-isnt-special">What we do isn’t special</h3>

<p>It is how we do it that is different. You may say: “But this is just a blog” and you are right, it is. It is just like the nytimes.com or MTV.com; we write articles in a web-log, where we share links with pictures and videos, hoping you might want to read them. Except, well, it is hosted on <a href="http://alsenet.com?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="Alsetnet.com">a provider</a> that respect your freedom, <a href="https://www.gandi.net?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere">the domain name</a> is provided by a registrar that respect your freedom, and all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="Open Source Software">tools to build it</a> are forged by communities that respect your freedom. And the curators, like me, only care about one thing: the relation between the art and the human, when the artist is free to create and the human is free to feel. No “accept these cookies” strings attached.</p>

<p>It takes great detachement and economical freedom to create something personal; detachement from the expectations of society regarding what your personality should be, and economical freedom to enable the time and energy required to develop said personality. Thanks to the free software community and the dedication of fire-soul enhanced humanoids such as <a href="https://github.com/aengl?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="Lynn Smeria's Github">Lynn Smeria</a> it has been possible to render this page on a very particular premiss, that is only given to humans: Friendship cultivation. The <a href="https://www.fsf.org/?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="Free Software Foundation">free software community</a> enabled the machine that this page is rendered on, and Lynn created <a href="https://github.com/aengl/publikator?ref=TheOuternationalMusicSyndicateWasHere" title="Git-Repo for Jekyll enabled Music Album publications">The rusty metal heart of the Basspistol release machine</a>.</p>

<h3 id="so-whats-next">So what’s next?</h3>

<p>Hopefully in your company, a lot. But if i spoiled it now, would you come back tomorrow to read the next post?</p>

<p>Yours, with friendly regards,</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>A-WA is a band formed by 3 sisters who combine Yemenite folk singing with electronic dance music.</p>

<p>Lyrics: <br />
حبيبي بكى اعياني, مبيش مثله حبيب ثاني حبيبي بكى اعياني, وكم رحله وخلاني حبيب قلبي ويا عيني عجب من عيبك مني عجب من عيبك مني, جهل ياكل ولا يهني, حبيب قلبي ويا عيني, عجب من عيبك مني من اول طلعة الفجر, حنق خيلي وسار يجري حنق خيلي وسار يجري, حنق يا ناس وما بدري, حبيب قلبي ويا عيني عجب من عيبك مني حبيب القلب اعياني , سنة وشهرين وما جاني سنة وشهرين وما جاني, يا ناس رحله وشجاني, حبيب قلبي ويا عيني عجب من عيبك مني لمن اشكي ويفهمني, لمن ابكي ويرحمني لمن ابكي ويرحمني, منو منكم يساعدني حبيب قلبي ويا عيني عجب من عيبك مني</p>

<p>Translation: <br />
Love of my heart, my eyes <br />
It is a wonder who has set you against me <br />
He dared to eat but not be satisfied <br />
And as the dawn rose <br />
My love got upset and left running <br />
My love got upset, o’ people!, and I am left unknowing <br />
Love my of heart, my eyes… <br />
My love has made my eyes cry <br />
He rose and left me <br />
And there is no other love like him Love of my heart, my eyes… <br />
Love of my heart, my eyes <br />
A year and a half has passed and he has not returned to me <br />
O’ people, he has left and driven me mad <br />
Love of my heart, my eyes… <br />
To whom can I bemoan that will understand me? <br />
To whom can I cry that will pity me? <br />
Which of you will help me? Love of my heart, my eyes…<br /></p>
